# Domain Maker for Laravel

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.md)

## The Why
Domain Driven Design helps us to organize our thoughts and to build apps using logical grouping of our code. 

If you've ever worked on a large laravel project you know how that model directory can grow so large that your ability to find things becomes hampered. 

I was inspired by this article https://freek.dev/1486-getting-started-with-domain-oriented-laravel from Freek at Spatie to refactor to Domains. 
I love it! It makes it so much easier to focus on a specific issue without the need to traverse the entire code base. 
If I'm working on Payments, I live in the payments Domain.  

I soon realized refactoring to DDD is pretty straight forward, but the typically wonderful development experience I've grown used to with laravel
left a bit to be desired. 

Also, what if I know my project is going to be large, and I want to get a head start and begin development using DDD?

That's why this package exists. 



## How can Domain Maker help you?
Domain Maker makes Domain Driven Development easier in Laravel by providing you with a set of commands to create the scaffolding and boilerplate 
laravel normally provides but tailored to a Domain Oriented Structure. 

* Helpful Commands to:
  * Automatically scaffold a new Domain with the often needed directories and classes
  * create controllers
  * create route files
* Automatic Routes discovery (no need to register routes in the RouteServiceProvider)
*

### All Domain Maker Commands are under the prefix domain.

```bash
 domain:make:controller        Create a new controller class
 domain:make:domain            Create a new Domain
 domain:make:routes            Create a new routes for domain
 ...
```

## Install
```bash
composer require phpsquad/domain-maker
```

## Usage

### Create new Domain
```bash
php artisan domain:make:domain
```
If this is the first domain the Domains directory will be created under app/Domains along with the specified domain. 

```Bash
Domains
├── Invoice
│   ├── Http
│   │   ├── Controllers
│   │   │   └── InvoiceController.php
│   │   ├── Middleware
│   │   └── Requests
│   ├── Models
│   ├── Repositories
│   └── routes
│       └── Invoice.php
└── Media
    ├── Http
    │   ├── Controllers
    │   │   └── MediaController.php
    │   ├── Middleware
    │   └── Requests
    ├── Models
    ├── Repositories
    └── routes
        └── Media.php

```


### Routing
A standard route file is created when you create a domain via the `domain:make:domain` command. 
>Routes are discovered automatically via the DomainRouteServiceProvider

To create subsequent route files use:

```bash
domain:make:routes  <domain-name> <route-file-name>
```
For example, if I have a "Payments" domain, and I'd like to group my Stripe Routes I'd run the command like so:

```bash
domain:make:routes Payments Stripe
```

### Stubs
Public stubs will be used as a default. If stubs are unpublished, backups are contained in the package. 

There are package specific stubs that you may publish to override (i.e., routes.stub)

> If you don't need to make changes to the stubs it's not necessary to publish them. 
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=domain-stubs
```
### Views
If you'd like to auto-register views you need to replace the standard view provider in config.app.php

replace:
```
Illuminate\View\ViewServiceProvider::class,
```
with:
```
PhpSquad\DomainMaker\ViewProvider::class,
```
